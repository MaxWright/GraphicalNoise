This project was designed to be easy to implement new styles of noises in the infrastructure of this 
code in order to test the output of the noise. Within the code is numerous exceptions that can be 
thrown to assure that the all noise function adhere to the same ruleset:
	-The value of noise must be in the range of zero and one.
	-The noise must not extend greater than the defined dimensions.
	-For this project uniquely, the new noise must extend directly or indirectly from either Noise1D or 
	 Noise2D, depending on the dimensions of the noise. 

To Add a New Noise:
Place the new noise inside the “coherentNoise” folder under source in the appropriate dimension.
Implement an advNoice version in the appropriate folder.

The following files must be amended:
Noise.java
-Add an enum value to the list with a unique name for the new noise. Use a standard name for the coherent
 noise and put "adv_" in front of advanced version of the noise.

GUI.java
-Add a new NoiseRadioButton and associate it with the enum values you made, add to button group, panel, 
 and add the appropriate action listener.

Renderer1D.java & Renderer2D.java
-Add the enums for your noise to the switch in resetGraphics and mimick the code of the other sections 
 of the switch.
